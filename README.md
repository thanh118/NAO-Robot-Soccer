## Project: Build a Robot Soccer Apllication


Overview
---
NAO is a 58 cm tall programmable humanoid robot with 25 degrees of freedom, i.e. 25 different motors that control the joints of the robot. NAO robot weights 4.3 kg and has a built-in Linux-based operating system (NAOqi OS). Latest version of
NAO robots have a CPU Intel Atom 1.6 GHz, which introduces the challenge for programmers to develop the algorithms which would have lowest computational cost possible, so that even CPU of 1.6 GHz can handle the processing tasks. Each NAO robot has two cameras with maximum resolution of 1280x720, two infrared emitters and receivers, nine tactile sensors, sonar rangefinder, eight pressure sen-sors and four microphones. Development process of NAO robots began in 2004. Since then they have been widely used for research and educational purposes in universities and research centers all over the world. 

In this project, you will use Image processing and inverse kinematic to make robot play soccer. You will use the NAO API and NAO qi to detect the center of the ball and estimate distance from the ball to the robot. 

The project was written in Python. Use Nao behaviour include:
* ALProxy::ALMotion
* ALProxy::ALTextToSpeech
* ALProxy::ALBehaviorManager
* ALProxy::ALRedBallTracker
* ALProxy::ALRedBallDetection
* ALProxy::ALMemory


After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

We have included an Ipython notebook that contains further instructions 
and starter code. Be sure to download the [Ipython notebook](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb). 

We also want you to create a detailed writeup of the project. Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup. The writeup can be either a markdown file or a pdf document.

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting three files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file 

Creating a Great Writeup
---
A great writeup should include the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) as well as your description of how you addressed each point.  You should include a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  You should include images in your writeup to demonstrate how your code works with examples.  

All that said, please be concise!  We're not looking for you to write a book here, just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :). 

You're not required to use markdown for your writeup.  If you use another method please just submit a pdf of your writeup.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the data set. The classroom has a link to the data set in the "Project Instructions" content. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```

### Requirements for Submission
Follow the instructions in the `Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb` notebook and write the project report using the writeup template as a guide, `writeup_template.md`. Submit the project code and writeup document.

## How to write a README
A well written README file can enhance your project and portfolio.  Develop your abilities to create professional README files by completing [this free course](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777).
